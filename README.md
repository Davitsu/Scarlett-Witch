# Scarlett-Witch v0.1b

Scarlett Witch is a Game Boy and Game Boy Color game demo that I made for my final college project. This is a very early version so you can expect many bugs and incomplete things but, I think you can enjoy it :)

This version has 3 rooms that you have to complete by using Scarlett's special power that lets her to change the perspective!

By the way, this is the first project I made using assembly code (RGBDS) so don't expect the best code of your life...

You will need a flash cart to try it on a real Game Boy, or you can use an emulator. I highly recommend BGB emulator.

Hope you like it! And, if you want to share with me some feedback, you can find me here:
